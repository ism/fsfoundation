headline: Guide - Web Programming with F#
---

F# excels at building efficient, scalable and robust web solutions. Web programming is 
based around receiving a single HTTP request and replying with a result, which maps very
well to a stateless, functional approach. Advantages to using F# for web programming include:

* *Fast* - F# code execution is fast, using native code generation from scripted or project code 

* *Succinct* - F# is concise, readable and type-safe, for fast development of robust web solutions

* *Reactive and Scalable* - F# asynchronous programming simplifies scalable, reactive web programming

* *Interoperable* - F# interoperates seamlessly with languages such as C#, JavaScript and TypeScript

* *JavaScript-ready* - F# is JavaScript-ready through [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) and [Fable](http://fable.io/)

* *Open-source* and *cross-platform*
